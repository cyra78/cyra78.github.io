TBDs
1. bands template automatic slideshow javascript didnt work. so removed it from band.html. Will check later
3. profile_girl image that  remains on top... nice feature, need to restrict this to just that page/content container and not whole window
same for cafe image
same with startup logo image.. i think issue is with header tag... not sure
Also cafe image didnt load in mobile view
5. In cafe.html eat/drink tabs didnt work
6. sidebar contents grows its always scrolled to bottom
Also sidebar can be 40% of screen for cell but for desktop can just be 20 or 30%
7. next prev needs to be worked on

===clean up the examples
1. add a responsive layout for say poems

NOTES
1.#refs fro a href for navigation are now from inside the page.
If per page is one article then the #s can be from index.html divs itself
2. 2 types of menus closing nav and notclosingnavs js functions in index.html

no pages can have titles except for index.html
