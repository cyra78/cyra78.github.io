                Coralio reclined, in the mid-day heat, like some vacuous beauty lounging in a guarded harem. The town
                lay at
                the sea's edge on a strip of alluvial coast. It was set like a little pearl in an emerald band. Behind
                it, and
                seeming almost to topple, imminent, above it, rose the sea-following range of the Cordilleras. In front
                the
                sea was spread, a smiling jailer, but even more incorruptible than the frowning mountains. The waves
                swished
                along the smooth beach; the parrots screamed in the orange and ceiba-trees; the palms waved their limber
                fronds foolishly like an awkward chorus at the prima donna's cue to enter.<br><br>
                Suddenly the town was full of excitement. A native boy dashed down a grass-grown street, shrieking:
                "_Busca el
                Señor Goodwin. Ha venido un telégrafo por el!_"<br><br>
                The word passed quickly. Telegrams do not often come to anyone in Coralio. The cry for Señor Goodwin was
                taken
                up by a dozen officious voices. The main street running parallel to the beach became populated with those
                who
                desired to expedite the delivery of the despatch. Knots of women with complexions varying from palest
                olive to
                deepest brown gathered at street corners and plaintively carolled: "_Un telégrafo por Señor Goodwin!_" The
                _comandante_, Don Señor el Coronel Encarnación Rios, who was loyal to the Ins and suspected Goodwin's
                devotion
                to the Outs, hissed: "Aha!" and wrote in his secret memorandum book the accusive fact that Señor Goodwin
                had
                on that momentous date received a telegram.<br><br>

              In the midst of the hullabaloo a man stepped to the door of a small wooden building and looked out. Above
              the
              door was a sign that read "Keogh and Clancy"--a nomenclature that seemed not to be indigenous to that
              tropical
              soil. The man in the door was Billy Keogh, scout of fortune and progress and latter-day rover of the
              Spanish
              Main. Tintypes and photographs were the weapons with which Keogh and Clancy were at that time assailing
              the
              hopeless shores. Outside the shop were set two large frames filled with specimens of their art and
              skill.<br><br>
              Keogh leaned in the doorway, his bold and humorous countenance wearing a look of interest at the unusual
              influx of life and sound into the street. When the meaning of the disturbance became clear to him he
              placed a
              hand beside his mouth and shouted: "Hey! Frank!" in such a robustious voice that the feeble clamour of the
              natives was drowned and silenced.<br><br>
              Fifty yards away, on the seaward side of the street, stood the abode of the consul for the United States.
              Out
              from the door of this building tumbled Goodwin at the call. He had been smoking with Willard Geddie, the
              consul, on the back porch of the consulate, which was conceded to be the coolest spot in Coralio.<br><br>
