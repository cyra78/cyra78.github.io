TBDs/ISSUES
1. bands template automatic slideshow javascript didnt work. so removed it from band.html. Will check later
2. tbd close menu if clicking on base page
3. profile_girl image that  remains on top... nice feature, need to restrict this to just that page/content container and not whole window
same for cafe image
same with startup logo image.. i think issue is with header tag... not sure
Also cafe image didnt load in mobile view
4. font getting applied to body..need to keep it per article/file
5. In cafe.html eat/drink tabs didnt work

Must fix issues 
6. sidebar contents grows its always scrolled to bottom
Also sidebar can be 40% of screen for cell but for desktop can just be 20 or 30%
7. next prev needs to be worked on
8. side bar contents need to reduce spacing for it to be more compacted"

NOTES
1.#refs for <a href for side bar navigation can be from inside the article pages too.
For simplicity they are set for the w3-include-html tag in index.html
Also an article can have multiple #hrefs for content lookup as well
2. 2 types of sidebar closingnav and notclosingnavs js functions in index.html

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR EDITORS
no article pages can have titles except for index.html
no article pages can have styles on body.
As much as possible no scripts needed in articles htmls. They work but lets keep only for rarest of rarest
No styles that are not from w3 css as much as possible

Have samples
	tmp/2 is good. Have reference to important samples from w3
