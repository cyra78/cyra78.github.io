2. tbd close menu if clicking on base page
3. profile_girl image that  remains on top... nice feature, need to restrict this to just that page/content container and not whole window

Also cafe image didnt load in mobile view
4. font getting applied to body..need to keep it per article/file
5. In cafe.html eat/drink tabs didnt work
