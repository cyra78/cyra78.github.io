              <p>After serving grueling jail time in my convent boarding, I was finally getting a chance to spread my
                wings. Leaving behind years of suffocation with no regrets: nuns and parents watching over my
                shoulder made me one of Pavlov’s dogs, a bell that programmed me to listen, to pray, to eat and to
                confess, competitive classmates who talked only about IIT dreams, coaching classes which I happily
                traded to catch up on movies and finally the big entrance exam which I royally flunked to my parents'
                utter disappointment. For me, getting admitted for B. tech in Kasaragod meant escaping, living 500
                miles away from home for the next 4 years. The choice came with conflicting opinions:<br>
                “Kasaragod, it's the other side of the world ...”<br>
                “Maybe you should take a gap year and try again ...”<br>
                “It's the land of the infamous Kasargod Kadarbhai ...Kerala’s own smuggling goon”<br>
                I decided to take a leap and carve my future. Off to the land of the Bekal fort with burkha-clad
                blue-eyed women, Aravind Swamy look-alikes singing ‘Uyire’,’Uyire’, and blue waters of the Arabian
                sea. 17 years, a bag on my back, and an overnight train journey in Malabar Express. It was my
                version of ‘Shawshank Redemption’ and the beginning of the happiest years of my life.<br>
                Malabar Express ran every night from Trivandrum to Mangalore - a college on wheels with hundreds
                of us crammed up in every nook and cranny, with tickets and without, sitting, standing, sleeping, and
                passionately </p>

              <p>debating on everything under the sun. My own journey started at Mavelikkara at 8:00
                PM and ended in Kasaragod around 9:00 AM. By the time I boarded, the Trivandrum gang was
                already settled and waiting to meet and greet. There were the Trivandrum, Ernakulam and Calicut
                gangs representing the three big cities- everyone from stations in between, like me, pledged
                allegiance to one of them based on who our BFFs were. Being so far away from home, we built
                stronger bonds with our friends, greater feelings of companionship leaning on each other for support.
                At 17, we turned into lovers, therapists, and counselors overnight.<br>
                By the time I boarded, ‘Reppu’ Rajesh from Trivandrum and Arun from Munroe Thuruthu would
                already be on the train. Hit Kottayam, it was time for Rajan and Jackson to hop on. The train
                collected friends at every stop. We waited for our own nightingale, Priya P.T, to board from
                Ernakulam so we could hear her sing our favorite songs. We passed through tunnels and crossed
                bridges, our music blending in with the rhythm of train engines. For every trip my Dad booked the
                overnight sleeping berth for me, hoping that I would get a good night's sleep before we reached
                Kasaragod. Little did he know that I never slept, instead collected memories at each stop. I saw
                Aluva Shivaratri, Bharatha Puzha, and the North Star rising amidst the lullaby of Malabar express.
                There were lovers who made out in the top berth- first kisses, first touches and there were spies who
                peeped in and gossiped,

              <p> there were ghost stories shared under the moonlight, and safety pins to
                ward off wandering hands. We traveled for laughter and a good sunrise.<br>
                Whispering nights gave way to loud mornings in no time, with the hustle and bustle of street
                vendors- ‘Kaapi, Kaapi, Kaapi…’, on and on they went. My heart grew wings in the morning awaiting
                the most exciting part of my journey: daybreak over Ezhimala. I got up early and hurried as though I
                was waiting for the school's first bell, got my coffee, and was all set. If you never tried hanging out of 
                a train car, you have definitely missed the best experience offered by Indian Railway. One foot out,
                holding on to the rails, wind in my hair, creating my own Titanic moment - picture perfect except for
                handsome Jack Dawson to hold my hands. The view changes from dark green foliage to the
                never-ending mangroves of Ezhimala with the distant blue, green Arabian Sea. Then the morning
                sun pops out. Sunrise brings a whole new look and light to the backwaters: a golden aura. The
                never-ending array of plant roots sticking out of the water with migratory birds flying all around and
                fishermen spreading their nets. A view to die for.<br>
                I sat there enjoying the world from the edge of a moving love train, hopes and dreams of the future,
                without worries of supplementary exams, internals, heartbreaks, and love feats. It seems trivial now,
                but back then, our lovers’ smiles made the world stand still and a single tear broke our hearts. Lucky
                me, I experienced it all without leaving space for regrets.</p>

              <p>Nileshwaram welcomed me with piping hot poori masala and chai. Time to pack up and get down at
                Kanhangad and catch a bus to the ladies hostel in Poinachi and from there to the 2nd hour of Sabu
                Sir’s lecture in Theory of Computation. The nonsense complexities of an alien curriculum- Markov’s
                Algorithm, Combinatory Logic, and Turing machines- the perfect combination of topics to catch up
                on my lost sleep. Fading sounds of snores, sighs, dropped books, and pens in the background- I
                blend into the daily routines of college life. The cycle repeats again in two months, but this time we
                catch the Parasuram Express and to enjoy the daytime views of the Malabar coast. My life in
                Kasaragod is my benchmark for happiness - everything experienced before and after measured
                against it and judged, few ever crossing the bar.<br>
                Years later, I traveled across oceans and found my home in Chicago. One day during a snowstorm
                while sharing life stories over hot tea, my husband bragged on and on about his bachelor journeys:
                the sunsets in Sedona, waterfalls of Yosemite, colors of the Grand canyon, blue mountains of the
                Rockies and night lights of Las Vegas. I felt small and inexperienced, but I interrupted, looked into
                his eyes and winked :<br><br>
                “But Sweetheart, have you seen the sunrise over Ezhimala? Long way to go my man! Long,
                long way to go…!”</p>
