          <h2>Towards Rational Thinking!</h2>
          <h4>by Lakshmi Das</h4>
            <div class="w3-col m6">
              <p>Everyone thinks that they think rationally. But going by the interactions on online social spaces [and in real world], we also see that we believe every other person is being highly irrational. So, what I’m setting out to explore is- <br>
                Does this mean rationality is highly subjective? And if so, why?<br>
                And secondly can scientific temperament help in bridging these irrational divides? <br>
                <h3>The silent ones</h3>
                Before we get to the groups, that are often at each other’s throats during discussions, we need to acknowledge the existence of a 3rd entity that holds silence as the golden principle.<br>
                They may say, "we are busy with 'real' work”. One presumption is that those people have mostly conditioned their mind to a world, that includes only people and emotions, similar or familiar to them. <br>
                Which means they would inevitable react when ‘it’ touches their livelihood. History teaches us that it would be too late to act at that time. An easy reference isthe frog-on-hot-water analogy.

              In the midst of the hullabaloo a man stepped to the door of a small wooden building and looked out. Above
              the
              door was a sign that read "Keogh and Clancy"--a nomenclature that seemed not to be indigenous to that
              tropical
              soil. The man in the door was Billy Keogh, scout of fortune and progress and latter-day rover of the
              Spanish
              Main. Tintypes and photographs were the weapons with which Keogh and Clancy were at that time assailing
              the
              hopeless shores. Outside the shop were set two large frames filled with specimens of their art and
              skill.<br><br>
              Keogh leaned in the doorway, his bold and humorous countenance wearing a look of interest at the unusual
              influx of life and sound into the street. When the meaning of the disturbance became clear to him he
              placed a
              hand beside his mouth and shouted: "Hey! Frank!" in such a robustious voice that the feeble clamour of the
              natives was drowned and silenced.<br><br>
              Fifty yards away, on the seaward side of the street, stood the abode of the consul for the United States.
              Out
              from the door of this building tumbled Goodwin at the call. He had been smoking with Willard Geddie, the
              consul, on the back porch of the consulate, which was conceded to be the coolest spot in Coralio.<br><br>
