As of now just using this location as a means to load and see HTML/CSS/javascript experiments online.

https://cyra78.github.io/tmp/2/ is a sync of code from latets code of https://github.com/cyra78/DigiMag as of Aug 2020.
This uses w3.css and w3.js
The other code under https://cyra78.github.io/tmp/ is just either vanilla w3.css templates or some cleanups on them and experiments

https://cyra78.github.io/lbsmag/ is an older version of https://github.com/cyra78/DigiMag that doesnt use w3.css and more buggy. 

https://cyra78.github.io/parallax_trials/ is a dump of some CSS based parallax sites that was trying to deconstruct/reverse enggineer, to understand why no one seems to do good parallax for phones
